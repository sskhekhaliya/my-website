          <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>SSKhekhaliya</strong> is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, 
            an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn 
            advertising fees by linking to Amazon.in and other Amazon websites.  
            <br /><br />
            As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. This does not affect the 
            price you pay and helps support the content on this site.

          <h2>Advertising & Sponsorships</h2>
          <p>
            In the future, this site may display ads (e.g., Google AdSense, display banners, sponsored posts).
            These third-party ad networks may use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based 
            on your interests and browsing behavior.  
            <br /><br />
            Sponsored content will always be clearly marked, and I only promote products or services 
            I believe add value to my audience.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-party Services</h2>
          <p>
            This site may include links or embeds from external services (e.g., YouTube videos, Instagram posts,
            Goodreads widgets, Amazon product listings). These services may collect usage data independently 
            and according to their own policies. Please review their privacy practices before engaging.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            I do not sell personal data. Information may be shared with trusted service providers 
            (hosting, analytics, email delivery) under agreements that protect your privacy, 
            or when required by law.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            I keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy. 
            Non-personal, aggregate data may be stored longer for analytics or site improvements.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict 
            the use of your personal data. You may also withdraw consent for certain processing. 
            To exercise your rights, contact me at

          <p>
            This site is not directed at children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction), 
            and I do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If I become aware that such 
            data has been collected, it will be deleted.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            I use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. 
            However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
