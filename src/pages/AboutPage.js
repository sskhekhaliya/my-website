                    Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Saurav Singh Khekhaliya</span>.  
                    At my core, I am a <span className="font-semibold">fitness enthusiast</span>, 
                    a believer in consistency, and someone who is deeply passionate about the 
                    transformation journey â€” not only for myself but for everyone who 
                    aspires to change their life. 
                </p>

                    My Journey
                </h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Like most people, I didnâ€™t start with perfect discipline or motivation. 
                    I started with curiosity, with a desire to test my limits and 
                    see how far I could go. Over time, the gym became more than a place 
                    to build muscle â€” it became a mirror of life itself. 
                    Every rep taught me resilience, every routine taught me discipline, 
                    and every day of showing up made me realize that transformation 
                    is never sudden â€” it is the reward of <span className="italic">consistency</span>.  
                    <br /><br />
                    That realization inspired my vlog series, 
                    <span className="italic"> Our Consistency</span>, and later my fitness guide 
                    series <span className="italic">GRIND</span>, where I share practical advice, 
                    beginner-friendly workouts, and my personal experiences with people 
                    who are just starting out. 
                </p>

                    Beyond Fitness
                </h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    While fitness is at the center of my life, I am also a 
                    <span className="font-semibold"> creator and a lifelong learner</span>.  
                    I love exploring different ways of expressing ideas â€” whether itâ€™s 
                    through <span className="font-semibold">writing</span> novels that mix 
                    mythology and philosophy, experimenting in the kitchen with 
                    <span className="font-semibold"> healthy protein snacks</span>, 
                    or building <span className="font-semibold">modern websites</span> with React.  
                    These creative outlets keep me grounded and remind me that growth 
                    doesnâ€™t come from a single path, but from constantly trying, failing, 
                    and evolving.  
                </p>

                    What Iâ€™m Building
                </h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Right now, Iâ€™m working on expanding my vision in multiple directions.  
                    Through <span className="italic">GRIND</span>, I want to make fitness 
                    less intimidating and more approachable for beginners.  
                    With my homemade <span className="font-semibold">protein bars and cakes</span>, 
                    Iâ€™m aiming to create affordable and healthy options for everyday people.  
                    And through my stories and content, Iâ€™m constantly trying to inspire 
                    those who feel stuck, reminding them that small daily efforts lead 
                    to extraordinary results.  
                </p>

                    My Vision
                </h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    My future goal is simple yet powerful:  
                    <span className="italic"> to help people in their transformation journey.</span>  
                    For me, transformation isnâ€™t just about a lean physique or a perfect diet plan â€”  
                    itâ€™s about building confidence, self-discipline, and a mindset 
                    that refuses to quit.  
                    <br /><br />
                    If my journey can inspire even one person to take that first step, 
                    to believe that change is possible, then I consider it a success.  
                    Because at the end of the day, fitness is not only about lifting weights;  
                    itâ€™s about lifting yourself.
